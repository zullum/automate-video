00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,120
Once upon a time, in a peaceful sunny meadow, there was a peacock.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,280
Oh, he had the most beautiful feathers you've ever seen.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,880
So colorful, so shiny, they look like magic rainbows.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,200
Wush!

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,039
The soft wind blew, making his feathers shimmer as he stood by the pond, staring at his

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,280
reflection.

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,879
He loved to look at himself.

8
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:23,559
Ah, he sighed, no one in the world is as beautiful as me.

9
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:25,800
One day, a little sparrow flew by.

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,280
Flap, flap, flap.

11
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,679
She landed gently on a branch nearby and chirped.

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:30,920
Hello, peacock.

13
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,000
Your feathers are so pretty today.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,520
The peacock puffed up his chest and spread his tail wide.

15
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,520
Ssh!

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,960
Of course they are, he said, smiling proudly.

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,280
No one is as beautiful as me.

18
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,760
The sparrow tilted her tidy head and smiled.

19
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,439
That may be true, she said.

20
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:48,040
Her voice kind and cheerful.

21
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,159
But beauty isn't everything, you know.

22
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:52,799
Can you sing as sweetly as I can?

23
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:53,960
The peacock chuckled.

24
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,759
Ha, why would I need to sing when my feathers are this perfect?

25
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:00,880
The sparrow giggled, flapping her little wings.

26
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,879
Sometimes peacock, being able to do other things can be just as special.

27
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,879
Suddenly, the sky dot darker.

28
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:07,879
Wush!

29
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:10,240
A shadow crept across the meadow.

30
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,120
A fox, quiet and sneaky, was creeping closer.

31
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,599
Russell, Russell.

32
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:16,560
His sharp eyes locked on a peacock.

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,319
The animals in the meadow froze for a moment, then ran.

34
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:21,480
The sparrow flew up up into the trees.

35
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,200
Not flap, flap, she tripped safely from a high branch.

36
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,520
But the peacock, oh the poor peacock, his big, heavy tail made it hard to fly.

37
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,800
He ran in circles, his bright feathers dragging behind him.

38
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,600
Swish, swish, swish!

39
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,600
Help!

40
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,600
He squawked.

41
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,200
His voice loud and frightened.

42
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,200
The fox pounced.

43
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,200
Wush!

44
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,200
But just before he could catch the peacock, a farmer came running waving a stick.

45
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,040
Shoo, shoe fox he shouted and the fox ran away into the woods.

46
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,000
The peacock still shaking found the sparrow sitting safely in her tree.

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,840
You were right, he said softly, his voice trembling.

48
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,760
My feathers are so pretty, but they didn't help me when I needed to get away.

49
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,280
The sparrow chirped gently.

50
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,000
It's okay, peacock.

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,640
Your feathers are beautiful, and that's special.

52
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,400
But it's also good to see what others can do.

53
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,439
Everyone has their own strengths.

54
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:14,800
The peacock nodded slowly, thinking about her words.

55
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,759
From that day on, he wasn't just proud of his feathers.

56
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,560
He learned to see how amazing other animals could be, too.

57
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,879
Moral.

58
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:29,159
Everyone is special in their own way, and we should appreciate each other's talents.

59
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:31,479
And now, close your eyes, little one.

60
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:35,879
Imagine the soft rustle of feathers, the gentle chirping of birds and the peaceful meadow

61
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,799
as you drift off to sleep.

62
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:38,799
Good night.

63
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:39,120
Shhh.
